				<p>Hello! My name is Demetra and i am a 15y/o girl from Cyprus that loves to paint! I've actually be painting since I was a child. I started going to my art classes around 2 years ago! I don't really take it too seriously because mostly I do it for fun. In this website I'm gonna show you some of my favourite paintings that I did either this year or last year and give you some decriptions! </p>

				<p>This has got to be one of my favourite paintings that actually took me around 10 lessons to do which is exactly two months and a half [since I go to my lesson once a week]. It was the painting that made me realise how fun it is to play around and experiment with all kinds of paint , like watercolor , acrylics and other! Not only that but it was also something I am interested in so it obviously made it more enjoyable!</p>
